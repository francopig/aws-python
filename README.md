#  Tasks in AWS Bootcamp using Python on AWS Cloud9 üíª

Welcome to my repository! Here you will find all the tasks completed during my participation in the AWS Bootcamp, where I primarily worked with Python using the AWS Cloud9 development enviroment.

## Description üìÉ

In this repository, you can explore a series of tasks completed during the AWS Bootcamp. Each task is designed to reinforce my skilss in cloud application development using AWS and Python. Additionally, all tasks come with accompanying documentation in PDF format, exported from Notion, to facilitate understanding and implementation.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- Python: Primary programming language used in all tasks.
- AWS Cloud9: Cloud-based integrated development environment used to deploy and execute the tasks.
- Git: Version control system used to manage the code repository.
- Notion: Tool used for task documentation and PDF export.
- Google Drive: Platform used for storing and sharing files, including documentation and additional resources.

## Repository Structure üì¶

The repository is organized as follows:

Topic 1: Folder containing the task related to Topic 1, including the Python code and the documentation PDF file.
Topic 2: Folder containing the task related to Topic 2, including the Python code and the documentation PDF file.
Topic 3: Folder containing the task related to Topic 3, including the Python code and the documentation PDF file.
...

In addition, you will find the folder "Exercises Classwork," which contains a series of programming challenges solved on a daily basis. Within this folder, there are subfolders corresponding to each day when these challenges were completed, and within each of them, you will find the corresponding Python code.
